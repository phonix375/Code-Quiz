# Code-Quiz

In this application I created a quiz using Javascript and Html with the following functions : 
* When the application starts you see on the top left corner the current high score
* after you click the start button you will see a timer start going in the top right corner set to 60 seconds
* you are presented with a question, then you have multiple option answers
* After you select your answers you will get presented with the next question.
* after you answer all the questions or the time will run out will get to the end screen where you will see one of two options : 
1. if you have a high score you will be asked to enter your name,  and you will see your score
2. if you don't have the high score  you will see your score and an option to try again

* if you have a high score the application will save it to local storage with your name
